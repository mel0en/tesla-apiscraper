Selfhosted API Scraper for pulling Vehicle Telemetry from the Tesla Owner API into an InfluxDB visualisation on Grafana Dashboards.

Known to work with Model S, X and 3. Capable of handling multiple Vehicles in one Tesla Account

## Install

Paste the following in your terminal

```bash
# Enter your email and password to your tesla.com account
teslaEmail=""
teslaPassword=""

git clone https://github.com/mel0en/tesla-apiscraper.git && cd tesla-apiscraper && bash install.sh $teslaEmail $teslaPassword
```

## Usage

After the install you can reach the scraper at http://localhost:8023

Both logfile (apiscraper.log) and the config file (config.py) are mapped outside the Docker container, so you can view / change these whenever you'd like. After changing, just restart the container.

If you ever want to update the stack:

```bash
git pull
docker-compose rm --force --stop apiscraper
docker-compose build apiscraper
docker-compose up -d
```

## HASS.IO Influxin DB Settings

In HASS.IO, open the InfluxDB webadmin and create a databse named tesla. Conigure user and password. Open config.py in the tesla-apiscraper folder and enter the details in the configuration file.

## HASS.IO Grafana Plugin Settings

In the Grafansa Plug in Config, make sure the followugin Grafan plugins are loaded:

```{
  "ssl": true,
  "certfile": "fullchain.pem",
  "keyfile": "privkey.pem",
  "plugins": [
    "natel-discrete-panel",
    "pr0ps-trackmap-panel"
  ],
  "env_vars": []
}
```

## HASS.IO Grafana Data Source

Configure a datasource in Grafana with the following details:

Type: InfluxDB
Name: Tesla
URL: http://a0d7b954-influxdb:8086
Access: Server
Database: tesla
User: <<what you configured>>
Password <<what you configured>>

## HASS.IO Grafana Dashboards

The dashboards can be imported manually by importing the json files from the grafana-dashboards folder.

## Known Limitations and issues

- If you narrow down Timefilter too much, and there are no Measurements, you won't see anything in the Graph and Discrete.
- The Code is far from being clean and in some way spaghetti'ish. This will be cleaned up in future Versions.
- Boolean Values from the API currently won't show

## Some remarks about the APIScraper

- As stated below, the API is crafted for being used by the IOS or Android app. One challenge was to implement a reliable sleepmode. If the car is awake, the API keeps it awake, as long as requests occur. Once it falls asleep, parts of the API can be called to check the sleep state without waking up the car, however, when the scraper detects that the car doesn't change Values (not driving, not charging), it increases the Poll interval until the Car falls asleep. Once it's asleep it checks the sleepstate every Minute. This ensures, that the stats don't miss relevant portions of rides when the car was just woken up, an issue some other monitoring implementations suffer from.
